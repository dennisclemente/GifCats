GifCats
 
 A fun dynamic web page that uses Javascript and jQuery to  generate gifs of cats in various stages: surprised, while jumping, sleeping, dancing and fighting and many more.
 
 When the user clicks, one of the still GIPHY images, the gif, animates. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing. Under every gif, a rating (PG, G, so on) is displayed, which data was provided by the GIPHY API.
